# Betting Simulation and Mathematical Analysis

## About the Project

This project aims to create a betting simulation website with the purpose of promoting awareness about gambling and the importance of mathematical analysis in these activities. The goal is not to encourage gambling but to provide a simulated environment where users can learn about the probabilities and mathematical mechanics involved in betting.

## Features

- **Betting Simulation:** Users can simulate betting games without the risk of losing real money.
- **Mathematical Analysis:** Each bet is accompanied by a detailed explanation of the probabilities and calculations involved.
- **Realistic Interface:** The site offers an experience close to reality, which aids in understanding how betting sites operate.
- **Educational Tools:** We provide tools to help understand mathematical and statistical concepts.

## How to Use

The site is intuitive and easy to use. Users can choose different types of betting games to simulate, and after each simulation, they are presented with relevant mathematical analyses.

## Contributions

Contributions are welcome, especially those that aim to increase the accuracy of the mathematical simulations or that offer new perspectives on understanding betting in a responsible and conscious manner.
